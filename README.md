# News Crow - Collection of utilities for repeatedly collecting news items from RSS feeds and the bing news API


### Ideas To Try

- Refine cliques method, try altering maximum-linkage limit to remove "overarching" topics?  Implement this instead of
removing search terms from entities table
- Apply PageRank to cliques results to identify most exclusive?
- Try limiting the number of entities to the most common x (?) and see if that collapses the network into exclusive
connected components
